# Metro_Frequent_Trevellers
Metro frequent traveller list using insertion sort and merge sort
In the first case we are taking the metro travellers list and later sort it using the insertion sort, then after sorting will take the first five members and declare as the frequent travellers.
In the second case we have given two different zones such as North and South Zones. We need to find the frequent travellers in both zones. So we need to sort them seperately as well as combinely so as to get the frequent travellers in North zone, South Zone and Both zones.
The output will be a data of five frequently travelling people.
